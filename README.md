# Reto5_Other-Problems

1. Sam and Kelly are programming buddies. Kelly resolves to practice more as Sam isa head initially.
They each solve a number of problems daily. Find the mínimum number or days for Kelly to have solved more problems than Sam. 
If Kelly cannot surpass retum -1.
```
  SamDaily: 3
  KellyDaily: 5
  Difference: 5
  Sam is 5 problems ahead of Kelly and they solve 3 and 5 problems a day. 
  And Kelly will pass Sam on day 3.

2. Consider every susequence of an array of integers.
  • Sort the subsequence in increasing order.
  • Determine the sum of differences of elements in the subsequence.
  • Return the length of the longest subsequence where this sum is even.
```
  Array length: 4
  Number 1: 1
  Number 2: 3
  Number 3: 5
  Number 4: 7
  máximum posible length of a valid subsequence is 4.
